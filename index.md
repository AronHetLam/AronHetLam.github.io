Hi, and welcome to my GitHub page.

What you'll find here is mainly spare time projects, that usually end up being useful for something video production related.
I like cheap DIY solutions, and tinkering with electronics, which is where my project ideas come from, and the ones ending up being useful I might as well share with others. ðŸ˜Š
